qg_1L
=====
Based on qg_1L.m codes by Francis Poulin

Compute the stability of 1-Layer QG model with topography. Assume the flow is periodic in x and a channel in y. Converted from matlab to petsc4py/slepc4py

qg_1L_io.py is the same as the normal code but stores eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and parameters into binary files. You can view the plot by running the read_qg_1L.py file.
